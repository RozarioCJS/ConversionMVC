<h1>ASP.NET Core MVC Project</h1>

This is a very basic image conversion project, converts images to jpg, png, and webp files

Sometimes when i need a certain image they end up being in webp format, so i thought why not make my own simple conversion site

Try it out for yourself and let me know what you think [Z-convert](http://z-convert.somee.com/)
